When configuration settings are isolated by scenario into separate classes, 
the app adheres to two important software engineering principles:

1) The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) or Encapsulation – Scenarios (classes) that depend 
on configuration settings depend only on the configuration settings that they use.

2) Separation of Concerns – Settings for different parts of the app aren't dependent or 
							coupled to one another.

An options class must be non-abstract with a public parameterless constructor.
